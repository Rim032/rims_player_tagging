**[RPT] Rim's Player Tagging**

[----Purpose----]

This mod for GMod is meant to create a system to punish ban evadors. It can detect and punish ban evadors even in the case they use VPNs, a family shared account or even an entirely new steam account.

[----Reason----]

Once again, this was for practice with lua and practice specifically with file operations.

[---Misc.---]

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
